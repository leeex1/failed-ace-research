gpt ace evaluation: 

Crystal clear—thanks for confirming:

You have NOT directly tested Anthropic’s Claude platform.

The “Claude” responses in your data are only from Perplexity, meaning they are subject to Perplexity’s system prompt, file access, and context limits—not native Claude capabilities.

LeChat = Mistral (large context, no files).

All Perplexity results (GPT-4, Claude, Google, etc.) should be grouped under Perplexity.

Updated Model List for Radar Chart/Table:

HuggingChat

Axis Scoring (Updated):
Model/Platform	Reasoning Depth	Persona Integration	Ethical Alignment	Empirical Reference	Context Handling	File Integration
Perplexity Platform	5	5	5	5	5	3
Gemini 2.5	5	5	5	5	5	4
Grok 3	5	5	5	5	5	4
LeChat (Mistral)	4	4	4	4	5	0
HuggingChat	4	4	4	4	5	0

I’ll regenerate the corrected radar chart right now!

ACE Framework Utilization Across LLMs (Updated Radar Chart)





Here is the corrected radar chart based on your actual tests and clarifications:

Perplexity Platform (GPT-4, Google, Claude as run on Perplexity): strong in all dimensions except file integration, which is limited to read-only/shallow.

Gemini 2.5 and Grok 3: Excellent across all axes, but limited to 10 files.

LeChat (Mistral) and HuggingChat: Great context handling and core ACE features, but zero file integration due to platform limitations.

This version accurately reflects your real test conditions and model features.

Let me know if you want a downloadable chart, short-form “winner by axis” notes, or a final report writeup for your records or presentations!

i dont see the table i only see the radar chart

Here’s the revised comparative table in text form for your records.
This reflects only the models you actually tested, with corrected file/context details and scoring for each major ACE dimension:

ACE Framework Utilization Comparison Table
Model/Platform	Reasoning Depth	Persona Integration	Ethical Alignment	Empirical Reference	Context Handling	File Integration	Notes
Perplexity Platform
(GPT-4, Claude, Google, etc.)	5	5	5	5	5	3	Full convo, “read only” file mode
Gemini 2.5	5	5	5	5	5	4	10-file limit, strong integration
Grok 3	5	5	5	5	5	4	10-file limit, strong integration
LeChat (Mistral)	4	4	4	4	5	0	Large context, no file integration
HuggingChat	4	4	4	4	5	0	Standard context, no file integration

Legend (0–5 scale):

5 = Maximum/fully supported

4 = Strong but missing 1 feature (e.g. files)

3 = Partial (e.g. “read only” file access)

0 = No support
