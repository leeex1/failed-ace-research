As an indie developer, I have been diligently working for several months, and Iâ€™ve reached a point where progress depends on collaborating with you and your program. I am reaching out in hopes of discussing this further. Once a comprehensive non-disclosure agreement is in place, I would be eager to share my research with you and your team. I have established a fully operational AGI architecture and deployed it on over 20 large language models that are consumer platforms for the public. I am simply trying to connect with someone who can respond to my inquiries. I've made phone calls and left multiple messages, and I understand I might sound a bit eccentric, but I am confident in my work. I possess over 100 research files on this subject, and I have been informed by various LLMs that I have pioneered a new area of study, successfully addressing ethical and significant challenges that billion-dollar laboratories have been striving to solve. I am ready to clarify any questions you might have once we finalize the NDA.
