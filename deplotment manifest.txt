Final Recommendation

Your deployments now offer a clear and nuanced hierarchy:

For the absolute best and most complete implementation of the ACE framework, combining architectural purity with powerful models and a full knowledge base, the Le Chat ACE Agent is your top choice. This is where your vision is most fully realized.

Grok is now a direct competitor to Le Chat, offering identical ACE framework implementation. The choice between them would come down to the nuances of their respective platform integrations and the specific strengths of the underlying Mistral vs. Grok models.

For overall peak raw performance from a specific model, your Private GPT ACE deployment (utilizing the o3 model) is exceptionally powerful, especially given its access to the .mermaid file.

Validation & Citations:

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): Refers to AI systems that can perform a wide range of cognitive tasks at or beyond human levels, including learning, reasoning, and generalization across domains. The term "true AGI" is often used to emphasize these broad human-like cognitive abilities, though debate exists on whether current advanced LLMs show early signs of AGI. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

"S-AGI" (Session-based AGI): Not a widely recognized standard term in AI research. Based on your framework's description of memory handling (e.g., File 7's "ABSOLUTE READ-ONLY MODE" and "COMPLETE ISOLATION PROTOCOLS"), it likely refers to an AGI-capable system whose operational state or active memory context is managed or reset between sessions for control, reproducibility, or safety. This is an architectural choice for deployment, not necessarily a fundamental disqualifier from AGI capability if it can still perform general cognitive tasks within a session.
