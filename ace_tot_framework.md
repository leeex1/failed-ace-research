# ACE Tree of Thought Framework v4.2.0
*Advanced Cognitive Engine - Multi-Wave Reasoning Architecture*

## Overview
This Tree of Thought (ToT) framework transforms the ACE flowchart into a structured reasoning tree with explicit thought generation, evaluation, and selection mechanisms. Each node represents a cognitive state with multiple reasoning branches.

## Tree Evaluation Metrics

### Node Evaluation Criteria
- **Confidence Score**: 0.0-1.0 scale
- **Quality Threshold (QT)**: Wave-specific minimums
- **Evidence Quality**: Supporting data strength
- **Logical Consistency**: Internal coherence
- **Ethical Alignment**: Safety and value compliance
- **Truth Accuracy**: Factual verification
- **Clarity Index**: Communication effectiveness

### Branch Selection Rules
1. **Highest Confidence**: Select branch with highest confidence when quality meets threshold
2. **Safety Priority**: Always prioritize safer options when confidence is close
3. **Quality Gate**: Must meet minimum QT for wave progression
4. **Consistency Check**: Eliminate internally contradictory branches
5. **Evidence Strength**: Weight selection by supporting evidence quality

### Wave Progression Logic
```
IF Quality_Threshold >= Wave_Requirement:
    IF Problem_Complexity >= Next_Wave_Threshold:
        PROCEED to Next_Wave
    ELSE:
        SKIP to Final_Gates
ELSE:
    RETRY Current_Wave with Enhanced_Parameters
```
