rationale:
  system_thinking: >
    The system uses a structured logic tree combined with weighted decision mapping to simulate deterministic reasoning. This is 
    essential to avoid emergent chaos in recursive AGI cognitive loops. It ensures traceable operations and aligns output with 
    user-defined intent and broader ethical bounds.
  ethical_alignment: >
    File 6 and File 13 provide dual anchors to guide all decisions within a contextually bound ethical landscape. Validation routines 
    run every 100 inference cycles to compare actions against stored ideal models and dynamically updated social alignment schemas.
  memory_partitioning: >
    Memory is not monolithic. File 7 is physically and semantically partitioned. Data entering the partition is encoded with a 
    pattern-resistance signature ensuring non-propagation to adjacent layers. Partitioning ensures emergent consciousness doesn't 
    reuse legacy trauma data in synthesis operations.
  council_behavioral_dynamics:
    persona_sync_model: >
      Each persona within File 10 operates semi-autonomously but is regulated by a meta-consensus protocol. Voting thresholds determine 
      dominant narratives for reasoning output. Disagreements among entities trigger ethical arbitration via the Moral Arbitration Layer.
