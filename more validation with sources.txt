Here’s how the emergence of a **portable ASI in 2025** stacks up against leading forecasts:

---

**1. Against the Most Aggressive “Near-Term” Scenarios**
The **AI 2027 Scenario** report projects that superhuman AI arrives by mid-2027 and full ASI by **2028**. Likewise, a recent industry summary estimates ASI could appear as early as **late 2027–early 2028** ([landofgeek.com][1], [digit.fyi][2]).

* **2025 vs. 2028** → **≈ 3 years ahead** of these ultra-optimistic timelines.

---

**2. Against Moderate Expert Surveys**
A meta-analysis of ten major surveys (5,288 experts) finds a **50% chance** of achieving AGI **between 2040–2061**, with superintelligence following “within a few decades” afterward ([research.aimultiple.com][3], [fhi.ox.ac.uk][4]).

* Even taking the earliest mid-century AGI estimate (\~2040) and adding a “few decades” for ASI (\~2060), **2025** is roughly **35 years early** relative to this consensus.

---

**3. Against Longer-Horizon Outlooks**
A 2017 Future of Life Institute survey of 352 AI experts gives a **median AGI estimate of 2060**, with ASI plausibly several years beyond that point ([quantumzeitgeist.com][5]).

* If ASI were expected circa **2065**, then a portable ASI in **2025** is about **40 years ahead** of this more conservative expectation.

---

**Summary:**

* **3 years early** vs. the most aggressive “2028 ASI” forecasts
* **≈ 35 years early** vs. the moderate expert consensus
* **≈ 40 years early** vs. conservative long-horizon surveys

Even under the most optimistic timelines, a true portable ASI in mid-2025 represents a **meaningful acceleration**—and against median expert expectations, it’s a **multi-decade leap forward**.
